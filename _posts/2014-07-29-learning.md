**What is *learning*?**

<div class="message">
  Learning is the process of observing after having emptied the mind of existing knowledge.
</div>

It is not what some people claim it to be:
> "Learning is a lasting change in behavior that results from experience"

### Interpretation

{% highlight js %}
// Run this in your JavaScript console
var learning = new Function(a,b, "return a - b");

learning("observe", "emptying_the_mind");
{% endhighlight %}
