**What is *learning*?**

<div class="message">
  Learning is the process of observing after having emptied the mind of existing knowledge.
</div>

It is not what some people claim it to be:
> "Learning is a lasting change in behavior that results from experience"

### Interpretation

{% highlight js %}
// Run this in your JavaScript console
var learn = 	new Function("a" ,"b" , "return 'Learning = ' +a + ' - ' + b");

learn("observe", "empty_the_mind");
{% endhighlight %}
